# Agent Logs

This project was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT as a coding and conceptual support tool. All interactions with the AI system that contributed to the final solution are documented in the agentlogs/ directory. Each log file contains a plain-text transcript of the relevant interactions.

ChatGPT does not provide a direct mechanism to download full conversation histories; therefore, the conversation logs were manually copied and saved in order to comply with the course requirements. A shared conversation link will also follow at the top of each conversation log for better viewing.
